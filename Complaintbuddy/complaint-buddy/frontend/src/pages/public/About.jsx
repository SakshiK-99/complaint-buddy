        <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
          CampusCare is a college complaint and mentor-mentee support system built to make it easy for
          students to safely report problems on campus — from infrastructure issues to harassment concerns —
          without fear of exposure. Every complaint is tracked through a clear escalation path from CR to
          Mentor to HOD to Principal, so nothing gets lost, and every student can follow their complaint's
          progress using a simple tracking ID.
        </p>
        <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mt-4">
          Beyond individual complaints, CampusCare gives administrators visibility into recurring issues and
          department-level trends, and gives mentors a lightweight way to file weekly reports on student
          concerns — helping the whole institution respond faster and more transparently.
